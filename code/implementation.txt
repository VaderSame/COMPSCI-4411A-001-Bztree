STEP 1
Define the data structure for the BzTree. This includes the node structure and the tree itself, focusing on:

    1. Node Structure: Represents each node in the BzTree, containing:
        Keys: Sorted list of keys in the node.
        Values: Associated data or pointers to child nodes.
        Metadata: Information like node type (leaf or internal), current occupancy, and other concurrency control data.
        
    2. Tree Structure: The overall BzTree containing:
        Root node.
        Utility functions for inserting, searching, and deleting keys.


Programmatic Implementation

Step 1: Define the Node and Tree Structure
    Create a Node class or structure to represent individual tree nodes.
    Implement a BzTree class to manage the root and provide operations like insert, search, and delete.
