Intuition

STEP 1
Define the data structure for the BzTree. This includes the node structure and the tree itself, focusing on:

    1. Node Structure: Represents each node in the BzTree, containing:
        Keys: Sorted list of keys in the node.
        Values: Associated data or pointers to child nodes.
        Metadata: Information like node type (leaf or internal), current occupancy, and other concurrency control data.
        
    2. Tree Structure: The overall BzTree containing:
        Root node.
        Utility functions for inserting, searching, and deleting keys.

Step 2
Implement the Insert Function
    implement the insert function to:

Add keys and values to the leaf node.
    Split the node if it becomes too full (to simulate B+ Tree behavior).


Programmatic Implementation

Step 1: Define the Node and Tree Structure
    Create a Node class or structure to represent individual tree nodes.
    Implement a BzTree class to manage the root and provide operations like insert, search, and delete.

Step 2: 
    How Insertion Works in a Simplified BzTree
        Case 1: If the root is a leaf:
            Add the key to the root node.
            Sort the keys after insertion to maintain order.
            If the node overflows (exceeds a maximum size), split it into two nodes and promote the middle key to the parent (creating a new root if necessary).

        Case 2: If the root is internal:
            Recursively find the appropriate child node to insert the key.
            Handle splits as needed during recursion.
